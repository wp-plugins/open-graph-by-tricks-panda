== Description ==

There are dozens of plugins on the WordPress repository with hundreds of options and advertisements. So, we created an easy to use Open Graph plugin for your WordPress. We don't offer a premium or paid version, but all we offer is this completely ad-free version for free.

Our plugin adds following tags to your WordPress, according to post/page type:

`<meta property="og:locale" content="en_US" />`

`<meta property="og:site_name" content="Website Name" />`

`<meta property="og:title" content="Page Title" />`

`<meta property="og:url" content="http://www.trickspanda.com" />`

`<meta property="og:type" content="website" />`

`<meta property="og:description" content="Description of your website goes here." />`

`<meta property="og:image" content="image-url.png" />`

`<meta property="article:author" content="Facebook URL of Post Author" />`

`<meta property="article:published_time" content="Time of Post Published" />`

`<meta property="article:modified_time" content="Time of Post last modified" />`

`<meta property="og:updated_time" content="Time of Post last modified" />`

`<meta property="article:publisher" content="Facebook Page of Website." />`

`<meta property="fb:app_id" content="Facebook APP ID" />`

And that's now all. We will add more features in the coming versions of the plugin.
